# üìö isbnx

This is a fork and enhancement from [amigatomte/isbnx](https://github.com/amigatomte/isbnx/).

## üí° Overview

`isbnx.pl` is a Perl script to help organizing large collections of arbitrarily named, PDF-based ebooks by extracting the ISBN number ‚Äì if available ‚Äì from the contents and using it as filename (and optionally, to use the ISBN number as a unique identifier for online meta data fetching). 

Internally, the script utilizes `poppler-utils` for PDF-to-text conversion and `calibre` for meta data handling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```
isbnx.pl 
	[--parallel NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES] 
	[--sleep SECONDS_TO_WAIT] 
	[--write] 
	[--copy] 
	[--move] 
	[--completed-dir <target-dir>] 
	[--failed-dir <target-dir>] 
	<filename> [filename2 [...]] 
```

This Perl script takes a set of PDF files as input and tries to extract the ISBN number from each file.
If successful, the ISBN number is shown for each file.
In addition, the script also allows the following further actions:
  * `--parallel` -ize the execution to N parallel jobs
  * `--sleep` to add waiting time (in seconds) before fetching the online meta data
  * `--write` new meta data into the PDF based on online sources and by using the ISBN
  * `--copy` successfully and unsuccessfully resolved PDF files into different target folders
  * `--move` successfully and unsuccessfully resolved PDF files into different target folders

The target folders can be specified via `--completed-dir` and `--failed-dir`. If `--copy` or `--move` is used, the ISBN-13 identifier is used as the target filename for successfully resolved PDFs.

## üõë Caution

 * ‚ö†Ô∏è This script can be run to modify and move PDF files. Please backup original files before usage.
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è When using this script with a large batch of PDF files, it is recommended to disable parallelism and add a sleep time to prevent running into rate limiting.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

The following dependencies are required on a Debian/Ubuntu-based system:

 * `libparallel-forkmanager-perl`
 * `libsys-info-perl`
 * `libbusiness-isbn-perl`
 * `poppler-utils` (for `pdftotext`)
 * `calibre` (for `fetch-ebook-metadata` and `ebook-meta`)

## Example Usage

```sh
$ perl isbnx.pl --move --completed-dir okay/ --failed-dir oops/ *.pdf
```
Will process all files in the current directory. If the ISBN number can be extracted, the file will be renamed to the ISBN-13 number and moved to folder `okay/`. 
Otherwise, the file will be moved to `oops/` for manual review.

```sh
$ perl isbnx.pl --write *.pdf
```
Will replace (overwrite!) the PDF meta data of all matching PDF files by online-fetched data in case the ISBN can be extracted from the PDF.
